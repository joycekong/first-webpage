        <h1> What do House Rabbits Eat? </h1>

        <section> 
            <h3> 1 . Hay! Hay! Hay! </h3>
            <p> Hay keeps the rabbit’s gut moving and flushes out hair from grooming; without hay, rabbit gets GI stasis and dies. 
            Hay grinds the rabbit’s teeth, which continually grow and must have daily grinding with hay.
            Grass on a lawn could be okay so long as there is no pesticides or fertilizer sprayed on it. 
            House rabbits should not be left to graze on an open lawn as they can fall prey to large birds and cats. </p>
        
            <p> Type of Hay:
            Timothy (First Cut) - higher in fiber, course (good for gut stimulation and teach grinding)
            Timothy (Second Cut) - softer, leafier, more fragrant
            Orchard - similar nutritional value to Timothy but different texture. 
            Alfafa - good for rabbits less than 1 year old since protein and calcium rich
            Oat - fragrant, good treat hay for rabbits of all ages 
            
            Remember: Rabbits need to have an ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT HAY BUFFET 24/7! </p>
