                      Hay keeps the rabbit's gut moving and flushes out hair from grooming; without hay, rabbit gets GI stasis and dies. 
                      Hay grinds the rabbit's teeth, which continually grow and must have daily grinding with hay.
                      Grass on a lawn could be okay so long as there is no pesticides or fertilizer sprayed on it. 
                      House rabbits should not be left to graze on an open lawn as they can fall prey to large birds and cats.

                    <ul>
                        <li> Timothy (First Cut) - higher in fiber, course (good for gut stimulation and teach grinding). </li>

                        <li> Orchard - similar nutritional value to Timothy but different texture. </li>
                        <li> Alfafa - good for rabbits less than 1 year old since protein and calcium rich.</li>
                        <li> Oat - fragrant, good treat hay for rabbits of all ages.</li>
